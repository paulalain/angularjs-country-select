AngularJS country select
======================

Country select is an AngularJS directive for picking countries from a list.

It uses the same countries [this gem](https://github.com/umpirsky/country-list) does.
The list is in French.

How to
----------------------

1. Add the markup ```<country-select country-model="selectedCountry"></country-select>```
2. Add the dependency to your app's module ```angular.module('myApp', ['countrySelect']);```
